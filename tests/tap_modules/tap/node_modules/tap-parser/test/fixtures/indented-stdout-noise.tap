    # package - Easy package.json exports.

    ## Intro

    This module provides an easy way to export package.json data.
    It contains auto-discovery functionality, which means that it will
    find your package.json file automatically. Cool, ugh?

    ## Installation

            # Subtest: npm install package line
            $ npm install package

    ## Usage

            var package = require('package')(); // contains package.json data.
        
            var yourAwesomeModule = {};
        
            yourAwesomeModule.version = package.version;
